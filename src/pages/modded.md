As of October 3rd, Treehouse also has a Modded SMP! We run a custom Modrinth modpack, running Fabric 1.19.2.

The modded SMP is currently free to join, no whitelists! Just remember to have the [modpack](/treehouse-modded.mrpack) installed. You can use the [Modrinth app](https://modrinth.com/app) for this.

Remember to follow the Server Rules and Community Guidelines listed in our [rules](/rules) while playing on the server.

Have fun! ❤️
